Hand Tracking 3D – Draw & Create is a web-based application that combines MediaPipe Hand Tracking, Three.js, and Canvas Drawing to allow users to draw in the air using their fingers, then transform those drawings into physical 3D objects that can be thrown, moved, collided, and played with in real-time. This application utilizes the camera as the main sensor to read hand movements and finger gestures, so users can interact without a mouse or keyboard.
